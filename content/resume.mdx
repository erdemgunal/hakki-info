about:
  description: "My passion for the software world sparked my journey to becoming a fullstack developer. I have been developing projects with Python for the last 5 years, JavaScript for the last 2 years and React for the last year. My analytical thinking ability, stemming from my physics education, allows me to approach every problem with a logical perspective. Driven by the philosophy that 'time is money,' I focus on automating manual processes. In this way, I not only write code but also produce user- and business-oriented solutions. I aim to create value in every project with strong teamwork, leadership instincts and a commitment to continuous learning."
