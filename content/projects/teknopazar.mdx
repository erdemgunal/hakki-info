seoDescription: "fullstack e-commerce platform for modem and cable adapter recycling and resale: product wizard, image management, JWT admin auth, PostgreSQL and AWS S3."
problem: "A recycling business (modem and cable adapters) needed a dedicated sales website and a simple way to manage products. Generic tools were either too complex or lacked category, brand and image workflows tailored to their inventory."
solution: "I built a fullstack Next.js 15 app with a 6-step product wizard (category, basic info, status/brand/tags, price/stock, specifications, images) and live preview, drag-and-drop image reordering and uploads to AWS S3. The admin panel uses JWT (jose), role-protected routes and Zod-validated APIs. The storefront includes category and brand browsing, search, product detail with image zoom and markdown descriptions, newsletter signup and legal pages."
result: "The business got a single place to list and sell inventory. The wizard and Zod validation cut product-add time and input errors. S3 and the admin panel gave them control over product images and catalog without spreadsheets or external tools."
