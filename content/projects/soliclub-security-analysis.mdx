seoTitle: "SoliClub Security Analysis – University Payment System Vulnerability"
seoDescription: "A detailed security analysis of Marmara University's SoliClub cafeteria payment system, including vulnerability discovery and responsible disclosure."
problem: "I identified that the SoliClub payment system had a security vulnerability due to a lack of validation for the payment amount sent from the client-side."
solution: "I discovered the vulnerability by analyzing API traffic using reverse engineering and request interception techniques. I demonstrated this flaw with a demo application developed using modern web technologies (Next.js, React, Tailwind)."
result: "The vulnerability was reported to the university IT team under the principle of responsible disclosure and was subsequently patched. This project proved my competence in ethical hacking, API analysis, and system security alongside my web development skills."
