seoDescription: "ESN GO helps Erasmus and international students in Türkiye discover cities, ESN events and trusted content. Led the web project—Next.js 16, React, TypeScript, FastAPI, Docker. ESN Türkiye."
problem: "Incoming exchange students in Türkiye lacked a single, trusted place to discover cities, ESN events and student life information was scattered and not always up to date."
solution: "Led the web project: a monorepo with Next.js 16 (App Router) frontend and FastAPI backend. Delivered hero, destinations (dynamic from API), events, vibe/food sections, FAQ and Instagram integration. Used feature flags for safe releases, trunk-based development and small PRs. Project tracking with Kanban and Agile methodology."
result: "A production-ready web app that centralizes city and event information for ESN Türkiye Docker-based deployment, clear architecture and setup docs and a contributor workflow (CONTRIBUTING.md) for multiple teams."
