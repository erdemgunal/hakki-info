seoDescription: "Comprehensive research on visa barriers faced by non-EU students in Erasmus+ and mobility programs. 92% require long-term visas, 35% face unreasonably long processes. Data-driven policy recommendations for student mobility rights."
problem: "Non-EU students and young people in Erasmus+, ESC and ESN events face major structural barriers: long-term visa requirements, lengthy and opaque procedures, inconsistent institutional support and visa rejections that discourage participation in international mobility."
solution: "A modern single-page platform that presents the research, hosts the survey and publishes policy papers and survey reports. It collects first-hand experiences, highlights key findings and achievements and gives a clear voice to non-EU mobility issues for advocacy and policy change."
result: "98.6% valid survey response rate; clear identification of visa barriers and support gaps; evidence-based policy paper and survey report; stronger foundation for institutional and European-level advocacy; increased visibility of visa rejection causes and mobility discouragement."
