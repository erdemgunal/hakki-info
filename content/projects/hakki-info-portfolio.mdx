description: "A personal portfolio and blog built to go beyond the CV: projects, career insights and technical writing in one place, tailored to my own taste and workflow."
seoTitle: "Hakkı Info – Personal Portfolio & Blog"
seoDescription: "Full-stack portfolio site with MDX blog, dynamic OG images, dark/light theme and resume-style content. Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, MDX."
problem: "A CV alone wasn’t enough to share projects and context. As a software developer, I kept asking myself why I didn’t have my own site a single place for my work, my writing and the kind of career and technical content I actually use."
solution: "I considered Vite for a lean frontend at first, but I needed APIs and a full-stack setup. Next.js gave more flexibility: MDX for blog and project content, API routes for dynamic OG images, centralized content (gray-matter) and a resume-driven layout. I built a site that fits my taste blog posts, project case studies and career-useful knowledge with dark/light theme, readable typography and code-friendly article rendering (syntax highlighting, math, GFM)."
result: "A single place that works as both portfolio and blog: project showcases with clear problem/solution/result, technical and career articles and a resume-style overview. The stack and content pipeline also demonstrate modern full-stack and frontend skills from content to deployment."
