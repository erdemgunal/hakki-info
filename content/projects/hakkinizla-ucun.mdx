seoDescription: "Automation platform that finds the cheapest 2–7 day round-trip flights from Türkiye to Europe. Filters by duration, region, and price so you can grab promotional tickets fast."
problem: "With a Schengen visa and limited time, finding affordable short getaways was manual and slow. Airline promos sold out quickly; checking multiple sites for 2–7 day round-trips from Istanbul was tedious and easy to miss."
solution: "I built a full-stack system: a FastAPI backend that queries flight data with filters (trip duration 2–7 nights, regions, price range, dates), Redis-backed caching and dynamic facets for instant filtering. A Next.js frontend lets users search and filter results. The stack is observable (Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager) and deployable with Docker. What started as a local terminal tool grew into a unified search API and web app that removes manual searching and surfaces the cheapest options first."
result: "I used it to book cheap trips to Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Austria. The project proved that automation saves time and money and became the foundation for a startup. The platform now serves a unified search with facets, caching, and monitoring in production."
