seoTitle: "Hakkınızla Uçun – Flight Search Automation Platform"
seoDescription: "An automation platform that finds short-term round-trip flights between Türkiye and Europe, eliminating manual search and saving time and money."
problem: "Finding affordable, short-term international flights was a time-consuming and laborious process manually. Speed was critical, especially for promotional tickets."
solution: "I developed an automation system using Next.js and Python that fetches round-trip flight data and filters it based on desired criteria (2-7 days, cheapest price). This system completely eliminated the manual search process."
result: "Thanks to this system, I was able to find tickets to destinations like Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Austria at very affordable prices. This personal success served as concrete proof that automation saves time and money, eventually turning into a startup."
