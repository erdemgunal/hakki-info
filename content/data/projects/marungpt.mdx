seoTitle: "MarunGPT – AI‑powered Student Support Chatbot"
seoDescription: "An AI chatbot trained on Marmara University data that answers student questions instantly using OpenAI and Elasticsearch."
problem: "There was a lack of a platform to provide fast and user-friendly answers to frequently asked student questions (courses, schedule, campus services). This situation created a burden on administrative units."
solution: "We developed a chatbot integrated with OpenAI API and Elasticsearch, trained on the school's official documents. We created an intuitive interface with React and Tailwind CSS, managed data in MongoDB, and containerized it with Docker."
result: "This project enabled students to access the information they sought instantly and automated administrative processes. Although it did not have a revenue model, it was a significant case study to showcase my skills in AI integration and user-centric product development."
