seoTitle: "Monitorist – Real‑time E‑commerce Stock Monitoring"
seoDescription: "A Python-based real‑time monitoring platform that tracks inventory of hype products across 20+ e‑commerce sites and sends instant Discord alerts."
problem: "Manually tracking the stock status of limited edition (hype) products on e-commerce sites caused significant inefficiency. Since stocks were restocked without notice, missing opportunities was the nature of the business."
solution: "I built a web scraping automation with Python that runs 24/7. This system continuously monitored hype products, recorded stock changes in an SQLite database, and delivered instant notifications to subscribers via Discord webhooks."
result: "This automation provided an instant flow of information to me and resellers, offering the opportunity to act the moment stocks were added. This project demonstrated my ability to commercialize an idea, build a community, and generate tangible income through monthly membership sales."
