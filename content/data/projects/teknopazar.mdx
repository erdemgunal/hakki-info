description: "A modern and user-friendly e-commerce management system."
problem: "Existing management systems in the e-commerce sector reduced business efficiency by offering complex product addition processes and inadequate features."
solution: "Using Next.js 15, PostgreSQL, and AWS S3, I developed a comprehensive e-commerce management system featuring a 7-step product addition wizard, drag-and-drop image management, and secure authentication."
result: "This system reduced product addition time while lowering the error rate thanks to validations made with Zod. It helped businesses strengthen their digital assets by offering a more efficient management panel."
