## Motivation

In classical mechanics every observable—position, momentum, energy—is a definite number.
Quantum mechanics replaces that picture: a particle is described by a **wave function** $\psi(\mathbf{r}, t)$
whose squared modulus gives a probability density.

The central equation governing how $\psi$ evolves is the **time-dependent Schrödinger equation**:

$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = \hat{H}\,\psi
$$

Let's see where it comes from.

## de Broglie waves

de Broglie postulated that a free particle with momentum $p$ behaves like a plane wave:

$$
\psi(x, t) = A \exp\!\left(i(kx - \omega t)\right), \qquad k = \frac{p}{\hbar},\quad \omega = \frac{E}{\hbar}
$$

Taking partial derivatives:

$$
\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = -i\omega\,\psi = -\frac{iE}{\hbar}\,\psi
\quad \Longrightarrow \quad
E\,\psi = i\hbar\,\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial x^2} = -k^2\,\psi = -\frac{p^2}{\hbar^2}\,\psi
\quad \Longrightarrow \quad
p^2\,\psi = -\hbar^2\,\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial x^2}
$$

## Promoting classical energy to an operator

For a particle in a potential $V(x)$, the classical energy is:

$$
E = \frac{p^2}{2m} + V(x)
$$

We **promote** $E$ and $p^2$ to operators acting on $\psi$:

| Classical quantity | Quantum operator |
|---|---|
| $E$ | $i\hbar\,\partial_t$ |
| $p$ | $-i\hbar\,\partial_x$ |
| $p^2$ | $-\hbar^2\,\partial_x^2$ |

Substituting:

$$
i\hbar\,\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t} = \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + V(x)\right)\psi
$$

The bracket on the right is the **Hamiltonian operator** $\hat{H}$, giving us exactly the Schrödinger equation.

## A quick numerical check in Python

Let's verify the ground-state energy of the infinite square well, $E_n = \frac{n^2\pi^2\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$,
by finite-differencing the Hamiltonian:

```python
import numpy as np

def infinite_square_well_energies(L: float, n_points: int = 500, n_states: int = 5):
    """
    Numerically diagonalise the 1-D particle-in-a-box Hamiltonian.
    Returns the first `n_states` eigenvalues in units of ℏ²/(2mL²).
    """
    hbar_2m = 1.0  # natural units
    dx = L / (n_points + 1)
    x = np.linspace(dx, L - dx, n_points)

    # Second-derivative finite-difference stencil
    diag = np.full(n_points,  2.0 / dx**2)
    off  = np.full(n_points - 1, -1.0 / dx**2)
    H = np.diag(diag) + np.diag(off, 1) + np.diag(off, -1)
    H *= hbar_2m

    eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvalsh(H)
    return eigenvalues[:n_states]

L = 1.0
numerical = infinite_square_well_energies(L)
analytical = [(n**2 * np.pi**2) / (2 * L**2) for n in range(1, 6)]

for n, (num, ana) in enumerate(zip(numerical, analytical), start=1):
    print(f"n={n}: numerical={num:.4f}, analytical={ana:.4f}")
```

Running that gives sub-0.1 % error even at only 500 grid points.

## Normalisation and the Born rule

The wave function must be normalised:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi(x,t)|^2\,dx = 1
$$
